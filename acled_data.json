The demonstration turned violent as demonstrators pelted vehicles parked inside Parliament precincts with stones, lit bonfires and looted shops in demonstration. Police lobbed teargas canisters, used water cannons, clubs, and live bullets to disperse the group, and arrested 20 (other sources mention 100) people. Over 200 demonstrators sustained injuries (other sources mention nine, others 15), including an international journalist. Two people succumbed to the injuries. A public service vehicle windscreen was destroyed by a tear gas canister."

Clashes between the police and rioters ensued. The event was part of a nationwide wave of demonstrations against racism, far-right ideology, and in support of an open society. The event took place after the National Rally (RN) came first in the European elections in France and President Emmanuel Macron announced the dissolution of the National Assembly on 9 June, raising fears of a government led by the far-right party. The demonstrators demanded all parties from the left to unite in a 'Popular Front' (Front Populaire) ahead of the upcoming legislative elections."

Demonstrators rejected the statutory bill that seeks to regulate education as a fundamental right in Colombia, arguing that the bill was modified following agreements reached with opposition sectors, including provisions that would allow the use of public funds for the financing of private entities. According to the demonstrators, the bill would pave the way for the privatization of public education. Students and members of Indigenous communities also participated in the demonstrations. During the marches, several Transmilenio stations were vandalized, and a community mediator from the city's Security Department was injured with a knife under unclear circumstances. There were no fatalities."

A Filipino soldier's thumb was dismembered when a Chinese rigid hull inflatable boat (RHIB) collided with their boat. The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) presented documentation of damaged RHIBs, communication devices, windshields, and navigational equipment. They said CCG intentionally rammed and illegally boarded AFP boats. CCG personnel also towed AFP's RHIB and looted firearms and personal belongings. They were seen deflating an AFP RHIB with knives and pikes and brandishing knives, axes, and sticks. The CCG used tear gas, sirens, and strobe lights. The AFP said that the Filipino soldiers were unarmed, and their service firearms were stored in cases to avoid any misconception that the resupply mission was an armed operation instead of a humanitarian mission. A scuffle reportedly occurred between Filipino and Chinese soldiers. The Philippines deemed the incident a violation of international laws and Philippine sovereignty. Meanwhile, China asserted that the Philippine vessels trespassed and described their actions as 'lawful'."

        "notes": "On 17 June 2024, about 500 anti-China government people, including Tibetans, Uighurs, members of the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement, and advocates for Tibet and Uyghur human rights, along with a journalist, demonstrated in front of the Parliament in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, to call for free speech. They waved Tibet's flags. Simultaneously, about 500 pro-China people demonstrated, holding both Chinese and Australian flags. The demonstrators from both sides clashed. One demonstrator was arrested. The event was in response to China's Premier Li Qiang's visit to Australia. On the same day, both pro and anti-China government demonstrators gathered outside the Premier's hotel and lined the streets where his motorcade would travel to Parliament."

Abyan authorities issued a statement denying the abduction and claiming that they were carrying out a search for the man. They also accused tribesmen of damaging 1 civilian vehicle in the roadblock. Both parties eventually reached an agreement to release the abductee and lift the roadblock."

This demonstration was in response to China's Premier Li Qiang's visit to Australia and China's gift of two pandas to the zoo. The protesters waved flags representing Uyghur, Tibetan, Hong Kong, Australia, and East Turkistan, and called on the Australian government not to be swayed by 'panda propaganda.' They encountered pro-China government groups holding flags and chanted 'Shame on China' and 'Shame on you' at them."

The event was part of a nationwide wave of demonstrations against racism, far-right ideology, and in support of an open society called by CGT, CFDT, FSU, UNSA, and SUD. The event took place after the National Rally (RN) came first in the European elections in France and President Emmanuel Macron announced the dissolution of the National Assembly on 9 June, raising fears of a government led by the far-right party. The demonstrators demanded all parties from the left to unite in a 'Popular Front' (Front Populaire) ahead of the upcoming legislative elections."
