There were no fatalities or injuries as the missiles likely impacted the water. This was the first attack that Houthi forces claimed in the Mediterranean Sea. The attack was not confirmed by other sources. A spokesperson for the company managing the ship said that there had been no sign of anything unusual while the ship was anchored off the coast of Egypt's Alexandria port on 24 May. Houthi forces claimed the attack on 24 May without specifying the date of the attack. The ship was operated and managed by UK-registered company Zodiac Maritime, owned by Israeli shipping magnate Eyal Ofer."

The protesters also demanded that, through a law, the State recognize and compensate the victims of persecution, imprisonment, murder, and abandonment that members of the group suffered during the civil-military dictatorship."

The demonstrators formed a human chain outside the building, which security guards tried to disperse, before some participants broke into the building by smashing windows with hammers and other objects. Some demonstrators then ransacked the lobby. Security guards tried to fend them off by spraying water on them, and a brawl started. Police intervened and arrested around 100 people."

Attendees criticized the Ministry of Education for its failure to build cooperation with teaching and parent teams, as well as the academic environment. Additionally, speeches were delivered by members of parliament. The event turned violent when the rioters attacked a woman expressing dissent, prompting police intervention to stop the attack."

The encampment was organized by Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and joined by members of UAW and ATU Local 1277 (affiliated with AFL-CIO). Police entered the encampment, pushed demonstrators back, and cleared the tents, with demonstrators retreating to Dodd Hall and Murphy Hall, where they held sit-ins. There were no arrests or injuries. Though some pushing and shoving took place, no further violence was recorded. Police entered a building on the campus to expel demonstrators who had staged a sit-in, physically pushing some out of the building. This demonstration took place amid the Israel-Hamas war which began in October 2023. This was a pro-Palestinian campus demonstration after the arrest of student demonstrators at Columbia University in New York on 18 April."

Bronx Assemblymember Amanda Septimo (D) organized the rally. Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson (D), Assemblymember Landon Dais (D), and Public Advocate Jumaane Williams (D) spoke at the event. Another group of more than a dozen of people gathered outside the rally and called for Trump to be convicted and opposed 'dictatorship' in the U.S. A separate group of people demonstrated outside the Trump rally to oppose both Donald Trump and President Biden, and to hold a pro-Palestinian rally amid the Israel-Hamas war which began in October 2023. A third group of people countered pro-Palestinian demonstration and held a pro-Israel protest in solidarity with Israel and in support of former president Trump. Among the pro-Trump demonstrators were QAnon affiliates and veterans."

Houthi forces have been labeling MSC ships as 'Israeli' possibly because of MSC's trade relations with Israeli shipping company ZIM or because of the dual Swiss-Israeli citizenship of one of MSC's co-founder and co-owner.
